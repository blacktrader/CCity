Bam is a build system with the focus on being having fast build times
and flexiable build scripts. Instead of having a custom language it
uses Lua to describe the build steps. It's written in clean C and
is distrubuted under the liberal zlib licence. Available on many
platforms including but not limited to Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.
